In order to use this look at [test.php](test.php) for example of usage. 

Currently only uses the `classmap` implementation for loading classes in PHP 5.2.

This is not intended to replace Composer but to extract the autoloading functionality for projects still using PHP 5.2. 
If at all possible, upgrade to PHP 5.4+ in order to secure your applications and allow for use of Composer.
